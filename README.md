# Why? 🤷‍

This SPIKE project is meant for *us* 
to evaluate the possibility of implementing authentication
with `Supabase` whilst developing 
[our `Flutter` app](https://github.com/dwyl/app).

# What? 💭

[`Supabase`](https://supabase.com/)
is a Firebase alternative,
which allows rapid development of a project
with a Postgres database, authentication 
and several other features built-in.

We are going to be using `Supabase` 
with `Flutter` to create
a simple authentication scenario
in a Todo app.

# Who? 👤

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
who need to understand how `Supabase` can be integrated
with `Flutter` to create an authentication flow.

# _How_? 👩‍💻

## Prerequisites? 📝

This `Demo` builds upon the foundational work done
in our **`Flutter` Todo List Tutorial**:
